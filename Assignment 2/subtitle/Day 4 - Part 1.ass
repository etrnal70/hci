Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.68,0:05:13.74,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-Okay, from the first one, we just change the background
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.74,0:05:24.11,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-As we can see, the original background was ferrari right?i think its slightly deviated from the goal
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.11,0:05:33.74,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-Because there is no ferari car in this apps, so we put another car that suitable
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.08,0:05:39.22,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-So jusrt like that from the first page
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.22,0:05:47.05,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-then, for the register page is just the same
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.05,0:05:54.97,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-But in the login page we added a feature "dont have an account", and this is linked to the register page
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.97,0:06:01.68,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-So it's like making it easier for users. So you don't have to go back and forth to make a back, right? 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.57,0:06:16.51,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-if we login, we entered the dashboard. and in the main menu i think we have to merge the history and reservation option
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.54,0:06:28.22,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-yes the voice is in\N-i think let akbar finish it first
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.22,0:06:48.94,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-Farhan: (we are not changed the design entirely, we just change a couple think that probably need some improvement)
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.94,0:06:52.17,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-Yes , just like terms of layout.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.02,0:07:09.28,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-I think we need to merge the reservation and history. Then i make history inside of the reservation menu then....
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.28,0:07:16.71,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,.....this button, history button. if we clicked it , we entered the history, like that
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.71,0:07:33.48,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,- So , the navigation bar isnt that full, one button can have many functions. so go to the about.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.74,0:07:39.74,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-Now in the "about" part, the information on the application information dashboard was moved here. 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.74,0:07:48.20,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,Well, here is a phone number, right here is an email, there is a web, then after that, there is a license, right? 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.20,0:08:01.45,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-The application that you want the user believes. This application is reliable.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.45,0:08:18.22,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-Farhan : ( Just like the other application , there is a terms and policy right?)
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.22,0:08:36.00,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-Farhan : ( for example, Liz transport doesnt responesible for the lost items)
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.00,0:08:45.17,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-Then, there is a rate us button, i think this is an important button
Dialogue: 0,0:08:45.17,0:08:54.54,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-To make the application rate higher right? the last one is profile menu.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:54.54,0:09:02.40,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-Well, in the profile, right, in the original application, there is only an edit.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.40,0:09:07.77,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,- so right now there is an already a change password and logout
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.77,0:09:14.40,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-in the original app, the logout button was at top of the right in dashboard section right?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:14.40,0:09:22.45,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-if put it like that, im afraid user will confused about that button
Dialogue: 0,0:09:22.45,0:09:28.28,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-so i think it would be better if we put it on profile, so the user can be logout too.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.28,0:09:34.31,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-The save and edit still the same thing
Dialogue: 0,0:09:34.31,0:09:43.48,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-before, there isn't a change password right? i think this is an important button
Dialogue: 0,0:09:43.48,0:09:48.11,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-Because, if the user want to change the password, they can do it here
Dialogue: 0,0:09:53.34,0:09:56.08,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-Change password , anyother else, its a basic thing
Dialogue: 0,0:09:56.08,0:10:01.71,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-Then, after that, there is a logout button.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:01.71,0:10:15.05,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-Farhan : ( Talking about the logout button at the dashboard, i think not all people dont recognize that was a logout button)
Dialogue: 0,0:10:15.25,0:10:34.25,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-Farhan : ( so, i think it would be better if we put it in profile section ,just like other application)
Dialogue: 0,0:10:35.37,0:10:40.80,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-okay , the one on the dashboard isn't finished yet, Here, the main menu hasn't been discussed yet
Dialogue: 0,0:10:40.80,0:10:57.11,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-OK, let's go to the main menu. The first is for the driver. For example, before, when we click on the "menu," it immediately appears big cars, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:57.74,0:11:07.37,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-I think it takes up a lot of space, so it would be better if you make a column like this so it will be neatly arranged right 
Dialogue: 0,0:11:07.37,0:11:11.34,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-Then after that, if we choose 1
Dialogue: 0,0:11:11.34,0:11:19.74,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-Farhan : ( we choose to make it grid, is because we inspired from other apps....
Dialogue: 0,0:11:19.74,0:11:31.60,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,...like tokopedia, buka lapak and any other apps, that displayed greed when we search something)
Dialogue: 0,0:11:31.60,0:11:38.82,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-Then after that, we will choose 1...
Dialogue: 0,0:11:38.97,0:11:50.40,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-in the original apps, there is a description and an animation of a car.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:50.65,0:12:08.97,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-its just moving around, i think it would be better if we made it like a car image , preview and other else
Dialogue: 0,0:12:09.25,0:12:20.71,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-So i think it would be better if we make it like this, so the user now the detail of the car
Dialogue: 0,0:12:20.71,0:12:27.77,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-then, after that choos package
Dialogue: 0,0:12:27.77,0:12:36.97,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-this the inside of the choose package, if we click the request button, it will go directly to the with driver reservation
Dialogue: 0,0:12:36.97,0:12:51.45,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-Farhan: ( we can't reach the payment interface because we must do the transaction first, verify our identity and anyother else)
Dialogue: 0,0:12:51.45,0:13:01.51,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-Farhan: (Because of that , we cant improve the UI too)
Dialogue: 0,0:13:01.51,0:13:14.51,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-then after that, the rent car option. The rent car option is just same as the with driver option
Dialogue: 0,0:13:14.51,0:13:25.37,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,- Yes, its just the same, the difference is only about the button name, if we click next the form is same too
Dialogue: 0,0:13:25.37,0:13:28.88,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-if we click the payment we go the rent a car reservation.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:28.88,0:13:38.34,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,- the last one is the taxi menu, in this taxi menu , the changes in this taxi menu is quite a lot
Dialogue: 0,0:13:38.34,0:13:52.25,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-the first one is the address input, if we clicked the address, a satelite map will be appeared
Dialogue: 0,0:13:52.25,0:13:57.42,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-Farhan : ( its a hybrid map, the combination of satellite and roadmap type of map)
Dialogue: 0,0:13:57.42,0:14:06.85,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-there is a citizen house, i think its make the application heavy and wastefull
Dialogue: 0,0:14:06.85,0:14:14.91,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-Farhan :(As we know , in Indonesia there still so many people that using internet data package)
Dialogue: 0,0:14:15.08,0:14:22.85,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-Farhan : (i think it would be better if put a roadmap type in it )
Dialogue: 0,0:14:22.85,0:14:34.42,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-i think it would be better if it like this. its more slight and clear\N-yes, its more clear to see
Dialogue: 0,0:14:34.57,0:14:36.48,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,- we can see a tiny road in there
Dialogue: 0,0:14:36.48,0:14:46.31,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,- Then , the original applciation, the choose button is right at the top of right corner
Dialogue: 0,0:14:46.31,0:14:58.82,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-as i see, its covering the header, so i think it would be better if we put it down here
Dialogue: 0,0:15:00.17,0:15:05.40,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-So it will be more user friendly
Dialogue: 0,0:15:05.40,0:15:22.85,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-then , after that, Oh yeah, for here, at first, the price per passenger was the form of input, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:22.85,0:15:36.05,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-When I changed the number of passengers, and it wasnt changed
Dialogue: 0,0:15:36.17,0:15:46.77,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,- at the first its 120.000 then i change it to 200.000. after that i change the number of pasangger to 5
Dialogue: 0,0:15:46.97,0:15:59.17,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,- its change to 120.000 again , it like the price is already fix but still can be change in the interface. i think its not effective...
Dialogue: 0,0:15:59.17,0:16:03.77,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-so i think it would be better if we make it label 120.000
Dialogue: 0,0:16:03.77,0:16:10.74,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-Farhan : (if it can be changed i think we can make it more cheaper, not a fix price)
Dialogue: 0,0:16:10.74,0:16:14.11,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,- yes , its a fixed priced
Dialogue: 0,0:16:14.37,0:16:22.22,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,- okay if we clicked the request, it will go directly to the taxi reservation
Dialogue: 0,0:16:22.22,0:16:30.08,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-okay i think thats all
Dialogue: 0,0:16:30.08,0:16:33.17,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-Farhan : (okay, thats all right?)
Dialogue: 0,0:16:33.17,0:16:41.68,subs b ing HCI,,0,0,0,,-yes thats all, the think left is the promo i think, can you tell it how it works?

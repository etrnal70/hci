Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.25,0:00:13.05,b ing,,0,0,0,,-okay, from me, for the first time, thanks
Dialogue: 0,0:00:13.22,0:00:25.62,b ing,,0,0,0,,-Initially, I made this liz transportation application, not until a week, only about 3-4 days.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.62,0:00:29.77,b ing,,0,0,0,,-we dont focus at design on this application
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.80,0:00:42.28,b ing,,0,0,0,,-so there is a couple point that i think it would be good l like maps, the reservation and history sections can be combined......
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.42,0:00:44.25,b ing,,0,0,0,,.....or the menu can be made even more concise.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.31,0:00:53.40,b ing,,0,0,0,,-Continue to log out, profile, etc. which I also missed. 
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.40,0:00:58.51,b ing,,0,0,0,,-okay , maybe......
Dialogue: 0,0:00:58.51,0:01:10.42,b ing,,0,0,0,,-there is 2 section , UI and UX right, for the UX i think that has been a lot of input from you guys
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.42,0:01:17.57,b ing,,0,0,0,,-from the UI, Are you guys designing this with XD?\N-Yes, we design this with XD
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.34,0:01:36.42,b ing,,0,0,0,,-Farhan: (is there any input for our team about this improvement ?)
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.42,0:01:42.48,b ing,,0,0,0,,-okay, maybe i can try to share it, can you see it?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.42,0:01:59.54,b ing,,0,0,0,,-from my opinion, more to the design, but for the UX, there is a lot of good improvement,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.54,0:02:11.08,b ing,,0,0,0,,-it should be like that, so the point that presented by akbar, i think its already good enough
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.08,0:02:23.77,b ing,,0,0,0,,-Maybe just at the UI, because if I look at the mockup that Akbar shared with, its already a mockup instead of anyother else
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.77,0:02:33.11,b ing,,0,0,0,,-there is a last version that it's prepared to implement in the mock-up, so it continues to fit in the application.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.11,0:02:41.17,b ing,,0,0,0,,-from the mocup , if we want to implement to the android application
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.17,0:02:50.17,b ing,,0,0,0,,-Android has an design bridge called material design, its like design guideline from google
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.22,0:03:00.57,b ing,,0,0,0,,-convert it first according to the design material, then the output will come out like what can only be implemented into the application.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.74,0:03:05.14,b ing,,0,0,0,,-so, as what i saw from the UI just now 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.14,0:03:12.65,b ing,,0,0,0,,-just add guidelines from material design and then...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.65,0:03:21.94,b ing,,0,0,0,,-the for the car section, from my opinion , the grid utilization just now
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.94,0:03:33.17,b ing,,0,0,0,,-this is linear right? why i use linear is ......
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.17,0:03:38.74,b ing,,0,0,0,,....e-commerce has any kind of image and has a low image resolution........
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.74,0:03:49.37,b ing,,0,0,0,,....so it will show more for the content while in this rental application, the quantity is limited, not many cars
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.37,0:03:57.40,b ing,,0,0,0,,-then the second one is that the resolution I got is high-resolution, so it's good to be displayed in full size.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.40,0:04:11.08,b ing,,0,0,0,,-so what if we make it grid, it will be seems like a little bit out of content. Like if we make it grid , its just shown us three rows
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.08,0:04:21.25,b ing,,0,0,0,,-so thats the why i pick the linear one, then after that
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.25,0:04:31.57,b ing,,0,0,0,,-just now the slider one is good. here why i make it an animated background because i just got one photo of this car
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.57,0:04:39.71,b ing,,0,0,0,,- so it cant be like a slider image, and the rest of it , i think its already good enough
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.71,0:04:50.57,b ing,,0,0,0,,-maybe the last one is just the UI, at the design part
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.57,0:05:02.42,b ing,,0,0,0,,-use the UI design guidelines that requested by the platform. for IOS , it has flat design
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.42,0:05:11.42,b ing,,0,0,0,,-there is a flat guiedlines, and for android, there is a material design
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.42,0:05:25.00,b ing,,0,0,0,,- So they didn't just teach "How to design?" but they teach the UX too. Because there are also icons like what kind of good to use for online contrast like this.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.00,0:05:37.02,b ing,,0,0,0,,-then background utilization,space, margin and then shadow, this one has a kind of drop shadow at the card
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.25,0:05:56.57,b ing,,0,0,0,,-The intensity also has rules. The point is they want the applications on Android to be in the same circle as the OS.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.57,0:06:02.34,b ing,,0,0,0,,-so the design not changed drastically, like that
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.34,0:06:04.34,b ing,,0,0,0,,-Farhan : (So its basicaly similiar each other)
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.34,0:06:19.45,b ing,,0,0,0,,-yes you right, So the look and feel are the same. Between the OS and the application therein is on the same base, namely material design.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.45,0:06:32.57,b ing,,0,0,0,,-so that all from me maybe, In XD, I have tried it in the "new project" column. It's like downloading a plug-in or downloading a design
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.57,0:06:44.20,b ing,,0,0,0,,It's like a kit for material and a kit for flat. It contains icons, components on Android. You can use from there too.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.34,0:06:49.57,b ing,,0,0,0,,-it was there the last time i saw it, like that
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.57,0:06:57.54,b ing,,0,0,0,,-Farhan:(is a kit for material really there?)\N-wait i will try to open it, from the older version , its supposed to be somewher around here
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.28,0:07:03.91,b ing,,0,0,0,,- i think we must download it
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.91,0:07:17.82,b ing,,0,0,0,,-Farhan: (Actually we use a couple of plugins but not material plugin, i forgot what its called, Akbar do you remember what it is called?)
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.82,0:07:19.54,b ing,,0,0,0,,-what ? which one?\N-Farhan:(the icon plugin one)
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.54,0:07:23.17,b ing,,0,0,0,,-oh yeah the icon one
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.74,0:07:36.62,b ing,,0,0,0,,-Oh yes, this is on the material website. There is a plug-in. There is a design kit for adobe XD
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.62,0:07:47.11,b ing,,0,0,0,,-they provided us with a font ,continue button. So if you want to copy it, make a button, so it's not difficult to make a button again. 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.11,0:07:56.02,b ing,,0,0,0,,-just copy and change the colour according to the application, and the grid is already exist too
Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.02,0:08:01.94,b ing,,0,0,0,,-so it will be more better to implement it
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.94,0:08:07.65,b ing,,0,0,0,,-Farhan: (i was wondering, are you learn all the material design from this website called material.io?)
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.65,0:08:17.08,b ing,,0,0,0,,-Oh, I happen to think the material had training at the beginning. That's a drastic change from the old material to the new one.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.08,0:08:21.28,b ing,,0,0,0,,-from the hollow one\N-oh yeah hollow
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.28,0:08:29.05,b ing,,0,0,0,,-well, Google used to do training for developers who want to migrate to materials, and i join the training
Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.05,0:08:35.25,b ing,,0,0,0,,-its hard to following the traininig because they really explained the details like a philosophy of material
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.25,0:08:38.22,b ing,,0,0,0,,-is it kind of bootcamor something?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:38.22,0:08:43.68,b ing,,0,0,0,,-yes , its kind of bootcamp for android developer in bandung
Dialogue: 0,0:08:43.68,0:08:58.68,b ing,,0,0,0,,-so if you guys read the website, its all complete , there is all explanation why did they make like that, but its kinda hard i think to understand
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.68,0:09:07.05,b ing,,0,0,0,,-but from me, i think its enough from just XD material design kit
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.05,0:09:16.11,b ing,,0,0,0,,-and its just remains to be learned, there is already a guidelines inside of it so you can just follow it
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.11,0:09:27.02,b ing,,0,0,0,,-and you must following the rules. As far as i know, right now playstore doesn't accept an application that whose rules are far from the material
Dialogue: 0,0:09:27.02,0:09:35.45,b ing,,0,0,0,,-sometimes it can be rejected\N-Farhan: (so its like a standarization for a design and the applicaton right?)
Dialogue: 0,0:09:35.45,0:09:41.74,b ing,,0,0,0,,-yes, its like a standarization, It's okay for you to make your own design, but it is still acceptable based on the material.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:41.74,0:09:49.91,b ing,,0,0,0,,-yes, I  made a game, right? i think make a game is a little hard to follow the material guidelines
Dialogue: 0,0:09:49.91,0:10:00.45,b ing,,0,0,0,,-then it was rejected, but they given the solution to make it acceptable
Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.54,0:10:14.57,b ing,,0,0,0,,-I also downloaded the kits earlier in the material, are you find the icon by yourself?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:14.57,0:10:18.05,b ing,,0,0,0,,-yes from plugin\N-Farhan:(we got the icon from the plugin)
Dialogue: 0,0:10:18.05,0:10:21.45,b ing,,0,0,0,,-Farhan : (we got the plugin from the bottom left corner)
Dialogue: 0,0:10:21.45,0:10:29.08,b ing,,0,0,0,,-yes the bottom one\N-oh, from this one, okey then
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.08,0:10:35.20,b ing,,0,0,0,,-Farhan: (does material design provide us all the icon that you use to make the application?)
Dialogue: 0,0:10:35.20,0:10:42.74,b ing,,0,0,0,,-yes, for the standard action like......okay where is it
Dialogue: 0,0:10:42.74,0:10:53.71,b ing,,0,0,0,,-okay for example the logout button. the material provided the logout button. so for the standar action in apps, you can pick it from the material kit
Dialogue: 0,0:10:53.71,0:11:00.00,b ing,,0,0,0,,-and for the bottom button, I don't use materials. I downloaded it too.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:00.00,0:11:07.14,b ing,,0,0,0,,-actually we don't always have to use material design, because....
Dialogue: 0,0:11:07.14,0:11:18.05,b ing,,0,0,0,,...... its depends on client, usually material looks stiffer. Because this is where the basics coming from.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:18.05,0:11:31.08,b ing,,0,0,0,,-so if you want make your own design, as you follow the material guidelines, its stiaceeptable. Here the bottom one i didn't use the material icon
Dialogue: 0,0:11:31.28,0:11:43.17,b ing,,0,0,0,,-because if i use material people gonna.....yeah\N-people maybe gonna bored to see because its like a basic icon
Dialogue: 0,0:11:46.00,0:11:58.57,b ing,,0,0,0,,-yes like that, More concerned about pictures, if we take an icon or image from the internet, there is usually a maximum resolution of stomach pain around 42 * 42 pixels.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:58.57,0:12:11.77,b ing,,0,0,0,,-if the handphone use S20 with high resolution, it will make the icon image broken
Dialogue: 0,0:12:14.11,0:12:20.28,b ing,,0,0,0,,- the material icon is not a picture, they are a vector
Dialogue: 0,0:12:20.28,0:12:30.25,b ing,,0,0,0,,-like that, if we open the vector, its actually not a picture its kind of formula or seomething
Dialogue: 0,0:12:30.25,0:12:37.65,b ing,,0,0,0,,-so it didnt follow the handphone resolution
Dialogue: 0,0:12:37.65,0:12:46.57,b ing,,0,0,0,,-like that, if there is a high resolution pixel, the icon wont broken
Dialogue: 0,0:12:46.57,0:12:56.22,b ing,,0,0,0,,-so if we have a picture 42*42 pixel, and in my phone for example....
Dialogue: 0,0:12:56.22,0:13:06.40,b ing,,0,0,0,,....with the low resolution, its clear but if we see it from a higher resolution the icon will be broken
Dialogue: 0,0:13:06.40,0:13:12.51,b ing,,0,0,0,,-or it will be really small
Dialogue: 0,0:13:12.51,0:13:28.48,b ing,,0,0,0,,-its fun and many to design on android, that's why I think starting from the material first, I think the basics for iOS aren't that different
Dialogue: 0,0:13:28.48,0:13:44.62,b ing,,0,0,0,,-but i think the material was made up of why it is explained more deeply than iOS flat design.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:44.62,0:13:50.54,b ing,,0,0,0,,-yes like that, i think thats my input for you guys
Dialogue: 0,0:13:50.54,0:14:08.94,b ing,,0,0,0,,-Farhan: (so basically we must learn the material design first before design our android application right? because as you say just now playstore can rejected the apps)
Dialogue: 0,0:14:08.94,0:14:23.31,b ing,,0,0,0,,-Yes, you right, but you dont have to always follow the material, material is not just a ..... what is it call?
Dialogue: 0,0:14:23.31,0:14:35.57,b ing,,0,0,0,,-the material has a spacing-margin; the primary size must be considered the same as the font.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:35.57,0:14:45.42,b ing,,0,0,0,,-so basically font, size, margin, padding, and colour, that was the primary one
Dialogue: 0,0:14:45.42,0:14:54.02,b ing,,0,0,0,,-if we follow this 5 primary thing, even if we make a varied design it will be accepteddy google
Dialogue: 0,0:14:54.02,0:15:01.51,b ing,,0,0,0,,-even if we make a weird design but we still followed that 5 thing, it could be accepted too
Dialogue: 0,0:15:01.51,0:15:11.60,b ing,,0,0,0,,-usually , android have 3 color, named primary, secondary, and text(dark text, light text), moreover, now there is a dark mode, so there are more applications. 
Dialogue: 0,0:15:11.60,0:15:20.65,b ing,,0,0,0,,-so we have to make primaries light and primaries dark, secondary light and secondary dark the same dark text as light.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:20.65,0:15:29.14,b ing,,0,0,0,,-As long as the color matches the points mentioned. Usually still accepted
Dialogue: 0,0:15:29.14,0:15:39.65,b ing,,0,0,0,,So there is no need to really fixate on the material components
Dialogue: 0,0:15:39.65,0:15:48.31,b ing,,0,0,0,,-Like that, as needed...\N-Farhan:(so use it what are we need it right?)\N-yes you right
Dialogue: 0,0:15:48.31,0:15:55.05,b ing,,0,0,0,,-Farhan:(do you have other quesition akbar and hanif?)\N-i think its enough
Dialogue: 0,0:15:55.60,0:16:12.02,b ing,,0,0,0,,-Farhan: ( i just curious, do you make the website version too?)\N-no , its not me, its other people
Dialogue: 0,0:16:12.37,0:16:17.65,b ing,,0,0,0,,-is it bad ?\N-Farhan :(no its actually not)
Dialogue: 0,0:16:17.65,0:16:19.65,b ing,,0,0,0,,

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,200
Farhan : So, we can conclude its better to pick library that support the OS of most user, right?.

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:20,100
Yes, Sure. Because there are several libraries that depend on each other.

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,800
Is there anyone here who has ever developed an Android application? With Native?.

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,000
Not yet.

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,000
Farhan : We actually have a lecture about mobile programming at fifth semester i think.

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:33,600
Ohh Ok Ok. Just self-taught, there are many lessons hehe.

7
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,000
Just Self-taught. Many lessons.

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,700
Because if we waiting for Campus, that's long haha.

9
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,800
Farhan : yes, you right, it will be long.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,600
Yes like that. Just explore it and wait for the Campus.

11
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:02,100
So, in Android, We have many external libraries. So we dont use the default from Google, because it's not enough. 

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,800
So we use an External Library.

13
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:13,300
Sometimes the external library is depend by other external library. So like that and it's very troublesome if the project is big.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,200
If the project is big, we don't know how many libraries that depends each others.

15
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Like so. Who knows if i upload one library and then 
i forget this library is depends with other three library, like that.

16
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,700
Because only update one library (the minor), automatically the relation with other is not supported.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,800
This is often to happen. So, the update of the library is get into major improvement.

18
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,200
What is major improvement? Althought the version is up a little bit, like so.

19
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:55,700
Because, it could be depends by other library. it must be checked again when the version is up, we must testing again, like that.

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,100
That's what the most happen in Mobile. Android especially.

21
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,200
Farhan: we are still in the third semester, and we still learn from the theory.

22
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,100
Yes true, yes true.

23
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,200
Yes true, like so.

24
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:38,000
Farhan: we dont have much experience like software testing, software development just like you said just now, i dont even know the process of making application entirely. cause you just what i said just know, we are still in the third semester

25
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,100
Ohh ok ok, yes yes. That's fine.

26
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,200
You will internship, right? Later during the internship, you can also studying.

27
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Farhan: yes, maybe in fifth semester or seventh? i forgot.

28
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,200
Haha, that's still took a long time, Bro. Haha.

29
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
If possible, you can internship at start up.

30
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,500
Farhan: In which kind of startup?.

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,300
New Boss, because you guys will have many lessons, usually. 

32
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,800
That's my experince at Start Up.

33
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,200
Isn't Start Up must have a high hard work?

34
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,200
Ohh, you means the works is heavier?

35
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,300
Yes, like must got carried at the beginning.

36
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:32,400
That's true. In my opinion, if you are doing an intership at the settle company, you're task is limit at that point.

37
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,200
Sometimes there is no task, usually a new student just like that, like so.

38
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,200
We are not trusted to handle a big task, that usually happen to a new interner.

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:53,200
If at the Start Up, because the limit of human source and cost efficiency, etc, finally they use whatever is there, like that.

40
00:03:53,800 --> 00:04:06,300
So you will be guided by Senior Programmer in there to try to build like this, etc. So at the end, usually will be given more trust.

41
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:16,300
So you will be handle a live field-project, so you're role will learn many things. 

42
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Just for sure that will be more hard compare to Settle. But like Traveloka, Gojek, etc it's still Okay.

43
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,400
I mean, they're not yet like... Do you guys have heard about Agile?

44
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,000
Farhan: yes i have heard of it.

45
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,000
Agile ohh Agile.. Yes yes.

46
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000 
Farhan: oh Agile framework, like scrum right?

47
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,300
Yes true, Scrum. That's it.

48
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:48,200
A Company like that is usually adopted an Agile so they work will be efficient and keep maintenance.

49
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,100
Sometimes on a big Company if the task is done, they will do nothing like a week.

50
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:03,800
That's the point, so i recommend to go to place like Start Up and implement that.

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,100
Sometimes, usually that's pity. The thing is when we intern, we need to absorb many knowledge first, like that.

52
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:23,400
That's pity if we intern at place like we don't get much knowledge at there. So, as well as an intern in a good place, like so to get more knowledge.

53
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:35,000
Farhan: does startup usually always accept an intern?

54
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:42,800
Yes. Honestly if a New Start Up, they will looking for intern, Why? Because while there is money.

55
00:05:43,200 --> 00:06:00,500
Farhan: Because intern doesnt get paid right? i think its gonna be somekind a symbiotic mutualism, where the intern got the experience and the start up got a indirectly free employee right?

56
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,600
Yes. That's what i'm doing that time haha.

57
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:25,300
So, first is efficiency cost, second is we like... in Programmer, there is a Senior, Middle, Junior.

58
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:37,100
If a Senior Programmer, they have they own principle, own framework, like that. Usually it has been difficult to be channeled.

59
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So usually, if it's me, if i'm like hiring or finding a developer is looking a fresh graduate which is have a new experience like 1 or 2 years.

60
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:58,800
Why? Because i can try to synchronize how the development process, how to program, etc.

61
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,800
So, it's according to what is done in the office.

62
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,500
Sometimes, if it's like that is still accepted, like that.

63
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,100
That's it.

64
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:41,800
Farhan: Closing the discussion , and thanking to the developer for the time

65
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,000
Yeah, You're welcome.

66
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,800
Yes, You're Welcome. Waallaikumsalam

67
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,800
Thank youu, Broo.

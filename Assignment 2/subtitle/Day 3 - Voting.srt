3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:26,300
Good Night Friends, give thanks to Allah SWT because we can gather on the 3rd day of the design sprint, namely the discussion / voting that will be chosen later

4
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:38,200
to shorten the time, just start the first presentation from design Akbar Maulana. to Akbar Maulana, please welcome.

5
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,000
Wait...

6
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,000
It's Done?

7
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,200
Done, Done

8
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,600
Just play it or what??

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,800
Just play it already and zoom it

10
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,600
Okeyy

11
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,300
So, this is my design

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:32,400
the first things is Login and Register. In the original app, the image is a sport car image so we changed it into family car.

13
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:38,700
It's because sport car is deviated from the goal of the app.

14
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:48,800
And then, in the Register. there is just a basic Register, nothing change in there.

15
00:01:49,900 --> 00:02:04,800
And then, in the Login. Just changed the "Don't have an account", so if we clicked it, then goes to Register and make it User Friendly.

16
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:17,500
FYI Friends, in the original app doesn't have an "Don't have an account" so basically just a basic Register.

17
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:40,100
go Login, and then direct to Dashboard. In the Dashboard, changed it to just have a Logo, Promo, Main Menu, and Navigation Bar.

18
00:02:41,800 --> 00:03:01,200
In the original app, before that, in the Header that's have a little logo, name, and Contact Info and i think that is not effective so i changed it to only logo and the other component is wrapped in another menu.

19
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:12,800
And then, for Promo and Main Menu, in the original app the position is Main Menu first and then Promo. so i changed it to Promo first and then Main Menu. 

20
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,800
And then, what else...

21
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:26,100
so the Dashboard is just like that, just moving some component. And then go to Reservation.

22
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:54,600
Before that, in the Navigation Bar, the Reservation and History is separated each others. so i think History can be wrapped in Reservation because they have an same contents just With Driver, Rent a Car and Taxi, and make it one button over there.

23
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,800
so if clicked, and then goes to History. Just like that...

24
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,600
And then, go to About

25
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:17,100
in the old Dashboard, there is a Contact Developer in the Dashboard, in the top of it. so, we moved it here. in the NavBar About.

26
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:28,100
This is a Number Phone, Email and Web. and then, there is a License and then a button for rating in the Google Play.

27
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:44,600
And then on Profile, from the original App, there is only Edit button. But in here, i changed it to add Change Password and Log Out. And if we click Edit...

28
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,600
Edit and then Save, after that on Change Password must input a Current Password, New Password and Confirm Password

29
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,400
if Log Out, then goes out from the App

30
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,800
Ok that's done. so just only discuss about Main Menu.

31
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:11,500
In the Main Menu, there's a three option, With Driver, Rent a Car and Taxi. First, With Driver.

32
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:38,800
Nah, Umm... In the original App, the design is same like this but the car is bigger, you can see that. But in here, i make it coulumn so make it simple. And then, if we choose it...

33
00:05:39,700 --> 00:06:01,600
We're in the Menu. And then, in the original App there is only a moving picture of the car. But in here, i make it like this to refer the car.

34
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:17,600
And then, at the bottom just like the original App. If choose it, there's told to fill the input, and then if clicked it, it will goes to With Driver Reservation.

35
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:38,100
And then, the second is Rent a Car. At Rent a Car, that's basically same like With Driver. The different is just the fill input. The car picture is just the same.

36
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,300
And then next, fill up the form and click Payment and it will go to Rent a Car Reservation.

37
00:06:48,200 --> 00:07:01,000
The last one is Taxi, this is different from the others. Taxi is rent a Taxi or call a Taxi so the fill form is different from the others because have "Pickup Address".

38
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:21,700
If we click it, it will show up a Map. In the original App, the Map is on Satelite Mode. Satelite Mode can make the App heavier and not good looking

39
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:40,000
So, i made it white and it will show a small road instead. And then, move the "Choose" button to bottom. Initially, the "Choose" button is in the left side of Header.

40
00:07:41,800 --> 00:08:02,100
And then, umm... if choose "Choose", it will show a fill form andd then... Oh, at the Price / Passenger in the original App is have a bug. We can't change the price.

41
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:19,100
The type is input field but it can't be changed so i changed it to Label field. And if we click "Request", it will go to Taxi Reservation.

42
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:32,100
Done. The last thing is the Promo. Actually, the Promo is still same, there's no different between the original App. So, that's it from the Design.

43
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,700
Done. Thank youuu...

44
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:39,900
Okeyy

45
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,100
I'm in hurry, Right? haha.

46
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,000
*We're apologize, Farhan Mic is turned off here. So, we continue the design discussion with Hanif :).

47
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:04,000
Okeyy, thank you Aan for the welcome. Wait...

48
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,000
Do you see that? 

49 
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yes, we see it. Done..

50
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,000
Bismillahirahmanirahim, Assalamuallaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh

51
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,100
Waallaikumsalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh

52
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:47,100
So, i'm apologize my design is not final, but i finished only the front page.

58
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:58,800
So... In here, just let me explain because i want a new design flow, so i try to use material design for my inspiration design.

59 
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
soo.. straight to the design, there is a three menu's from 4 is simplified to 3. There is Dashboard, Orders and Profile.

60
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:14,100
For the Dashboard Menu, there's just swap the Promo and Main Menu place because Promo will be the Highlight for the App.

61
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:28,800
And then, in the Orders Menu, i try to make a simple from the original App that is the History and Order is separated and the Driver, Key Only and Taxi is separated too..

62
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,500
In here, i want to combine that with a status indicator. 

63
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:44,600
First thing here is at the top right, there is a status from the Orders, is that With Driver / Key Only / Taxi.

64
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:56,300
And then next, there is a date, times of ordering, a message, and then there is a status if they On The Way or Already Completed.

65
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,200
And then the rating if the Order is complete and if it doesn't completed yet, the rating is not showed up.

66
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,400
And then.. go to Profile. 

67
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:26,400
The Profile page have a some information. On the original App, the Personal Info can't show to User the text field is active or not.

68
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:34,600
So i just changed it to make it can be filled and after "Apply", the text field is inactive.

69
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:47,500
And then, there is a Contact Us Menu. In the original App, the Contact is separated and just a text but in here i make it a button so the user can press it and then can contact the developer directly.

70
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,200
And here also have a button to Rate Us and a button to Log Out. 

71
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:57,200
Okey Done. Thank You. Wassalamuallaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh.

72
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,500
Waallaikumsalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh.

73
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,400
Okeee, Vote...

74
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,100
Azzam First, because he is the first one joining the Discussion.

75
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,500
Whatever Whatever...

76
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:30,500
From the UI, i choose Hanif. Becaus he make it simple but also clear. For the example, at the Orders Menu, there is a On Going and others. So, he make it simpler and also the detail is still exist.

77
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:41,800
But from the Features, like Akbar changing the Maps, he said change from the satelite to different view.

78
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:56,600
So, i choose Hanif. Please then i leave it to Rudi.

79
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:12,000
Now? Okey, umm.. actually, from the button that has been created, you also removed the button at the bottom.

80
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:20,000
I think i choose hanif. Because the colour scheme like the gradation is awesome. That's the first one.

81
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:48,800
And then, he also add a feature like On Going, etc. But, i think on the front Menu, there is a Only Key. I'm afraid the User doesn't know that is just only rent a car key. if i think so...

82
00:13:49,100 --> 00:14:04,600
Oke for Akbar, i salute for the Maps, i swear it. For the example, sometimes User App is got limit by the Quota or device is not compatible for high setting.

83
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:15,200
And then, for the Contact that can be use. If in hanif that is united with Profile, i'm afraid the User got a missperseption

84
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,300
So.. the point is, i choose Akbar.

85
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,200
Okeeyy, Thank youu

86
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,100
Oke, i think i'm decisive because the result is draw.

87
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:37,000
From me, from the presentation that Hanif and Akbar did. Both of it is still having a advantages and disadvantages.

88
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:47,200
from Hanif's side, the material design is good. But, it still having some empty places. 

89
00:14:47,600 --> 00:15:06,400
There's a UI and UX, Hanif have more point in UI and for Akbar have more point in UX because have more features, but from i see, the UI is have some button that overused and then unnecessary use of gradations.

90
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:24,200
But of course if we see from the purpose of the App, that is more to the use value and help user to Rent a Taxi, etc so must have many features.

91
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:36,200
So from me, i choose Akbar. Because, although the design have an disadvantages, that still have more features and it will be the point that the user will use.

92
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,000
Good!

93
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:47,000
Wee, Akbar wee...

94
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,000
Waallaikumsalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh
